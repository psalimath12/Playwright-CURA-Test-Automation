    strategy:
      fail-fast: false # Allows other shards to complete even if one fails

        # Define how many parts (shards) to split the tests into

    steps:

      # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so the workflow can access it.

      # Sets up the specified version of Node.js (v20 is a good stable choice).

    - name: 4. Install dependencies
      # Install project dependencies. 'npm ci' is preferred over 'npm install' in CI environments
      # because it uses the package-lock.json file to ensure exact dependency versions.
      run: npm ci

    #- name: 5. Install Playwright browser dependencies
      # Install the required Playwright browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and their system dependencies.
     # run: npx playwright install --with-deps

    - name: 5. Run Playwright tests (Sharded)
      # 🌟 MODIFIED: Use --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ matrix.shard-total }}
      # This command splits the total tests into 4 chunks and runs only one chunk per runner.
      run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ matrix.shard-total }}
